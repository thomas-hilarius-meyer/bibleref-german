 1. Package description
 ----------------------
 
 The package bibleref-german provides translations and 
 various formats for the use of bibleref in German documents. 
 The German naming of the bible books complies with the 
 'Loccumer Richtlinien' (Loccum guidelines). Apart from 
 that, the Vulgate (Latin bible) is supported.
 
 Any suggestions concerning this package are highly 
 appreciated.
 

 2. Documentation
 ----------------

 The English documentation of bibleref-german can be found in 
 the file 'en-bibleref-german.pdf'. This file is intended for 
 viewing on a computer screen. A printable version can be 
 compiled from the file 'en-bibleref-german.tex'. You only 
 have to comment the line 
   \input{bibleref-german-screen}
 (i.e. put a % sign in front of it) and uncomment the line 
   \input{bibleref-german-print}
 (i.e. delete the % sign at the beginning of this line).
 Note: The fonts may not be installed on your system. The 
 following fonts were used for the documentation:
 * Linux Libertine in running text
 * Linux Biolinum (part of the Libertine package) for 
   headings
 * BeraMono as typewriter font
 These fonts are freely available. If you do not have these
 fonts installed in your system or do not want to install 
 them, you can easily use another font. The relevant 
 settings can be found in the file 
 'bibleref-german-preamble.tex'.
